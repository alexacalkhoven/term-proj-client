ENSF 409 Term Project Client

## Building
The project requires no external libraries to build

## Running
First, the server must be running in order to start the client.  

To run the project, run the `Client` class with no arguments.
This will start a client that tries to connect to a server at `localhost:4200`
  
To specify the address of the server, run the client with two command line arguments,
the host and the port, in that order.

## Notes
In order to log in, a valid student ID is required. You may either create a new student as an admin first, or use one of the
two test students that are created for every session, with IDs 1 and 3.
